Hence, the aim of this demo was to showcase CraftCMS.\n\nThis project was built in Bootrap 4. The icons are from [Font Awesome 5](https://fontawesome.com/). To maintain code readability and reusability, I used `SASS` as the `CSS` pre-processor. Note that this project doesn't come bundled with its own *`SASS` compiler*, as I was lazy to code up one üòõ... If you're using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can simply use the free [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass) VS Code extension.\n\n[Write up](https://dev.to/davinaleong/released-my-first-bootstrap-4-template-2b00) on [DEV Community](https://dev.to/).\n\nI came up with the idea of creating a fake company. This company specializes in developing custom web and mobile applications for clients. The audience of the talk was a local `PHP` community. Hence, I came up with the company's name \"Comphanny\" which is a play on the words \"company\", \"php\", and \"ph\" being pronunced as \"f\" in \"elephant\" which is the animal typically associated with `PHP`.\n\nI initally wanted to build this template from scratch, to practise my `CSS` & web design skills, as well as explore **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid**. But due to time constraint from my day job, and still having the CraftCMS part of the project to build, I felt it was too ambitious. So I decided to go building off Bootstrap since it was what I was familiar with."

The *yellow* theme is to emphasise my transition from `PHP` to `JavaScript` as my primary language of choice for web development. I've decided I'll only use `PHP` when the project calls for the need to use a `PHP`-based application like [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x) or [CraftCMS](https://craftcms.com/).\n\nThis project had 3 phases: mockup, templating and development.\n\nI first designed the mockups in [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/). It's akin to Adobe's Illustrator, and a good alternative if you don't need a subscription-based graphics software. Affinity Photo is their answer to Adobe's Photoshop.\n\nThe template is then developed in `HTML` and `SASS`. `SASS` is used over raw `CSS` to maintain code readability and maintainability. For repeatable-content like the project cards, I first stored a list of dummy project data into a `JSON` file. The cards are then rendered with `jQuery`, with the data pulled from the `JSON` file. **CSS Grid** is used to lay out the *navbar* and *main* content. It is also used to lay out the project cards too both on the Home page and the Projects page.\n\nOnce the template is done, I developed the app in `ReactJS`. To maintain code simplicity, I decided to keep it a purely static app; i.e. there is no database attached to it. The project's images are stored in a public folder; accessible from the app's root folder. I then used a `JSON` file to store the app's data like the site's name and author. This is so I can modify the site's content from a single file. Check out this project's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/davinaleong/proj-davdevs) to see more.\n\nI want to bring attention to the write-up portion of a project's details page. I'm using a `Markdown` renderer (`[React Markdown](https://github.com/rexxars/react-markdown)`) to render the project's writeup.\n\nBy the way, need some something to cheer you up?
